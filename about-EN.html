                    <h1>About José</h1>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently working with software developing, automation and whenever possible, 
                        information security.  In the year of 2022, i've graduated in Computer Science 
                        from University of Sorocaba (Uniso). This section is about who am i and my 
                        professional career until to this day.
                    </p>

                    <h1>A little bit of history</h1>
                    <p>
                        My first experience with technology comes to my curiosity in fixing computer due 
                        the amount charged that time, i've decided learn how to maintenance computers 
                        by myself which would later become a source of extra income in adolescence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In developing, i've started from the construction of indie games through 
                        Unity engine, where i made games using the C# language, inspired by my 
                        daily life at school, home and any situation that seemed a great idea for 
                        a fast and funny games.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During my adolescence, i've always been an information security 
                        enthusiast. In 2018 i've started my college on Computer Science but only in 6th 
                        period i've started my studies in information security. Within one month i've 
                        found my first vulnerability, reported for those responsible and won my first 
                        bounty, this one which i've used to invest on security career, which now i've a 
                        repertoire of found and reported vulnerabilitys.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the end of my college, i've done a research about assistive technology and 
                        how this can help with accessibility of visually impaired people. My end course 
                        paper consisted on a induction cooker adapted to blind people, where were used 
                        computer vision to capture user hands, audible warning in case of some risk and 
                        movement sensors to identify kitchen items.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In march 2021 i've started my developer career, initially fixing and improving 
                        codes, currently i'm working in process automation, front and back-end, security 
                        tests and bot developing. 
                    </p>
